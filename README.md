# Compiler
MAVN-compiler is programming tool which translates and compiles program written in higher MIPS 32bit programming language into basic assembler language. Higher MIPS 32bit 
assembler language purpose is to make easier assembler programming because it introduces registry variables which enables programmers to, during writing a program, use variables 
instead  of real resources which significantly reduces effort during writing a program.

MAVN language supports 15 instructions:
add – (addition)
addi – (addition immediate) 
b – (unconditional branch)
bltz – (branch on less than zero)
la – (load address) 
li – (load immediate)
lw – (load word)
la – (no operation)
sub – (subtraction)
sw – (store word)
and – (logical AND)
or – (logical OR)
nor – (logical NOR)
bgtz – (branch on greater than zero)
seq – (set equal)
